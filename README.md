<h1>Password Cracking Dictionary Attack</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

This project involves cracking passwords using various methods including brute-force, dictionary attacks with rules, and dictionary attacks with salt. The passwords being cracked are randomly generated from lowercase letters and digits and have lengths of 4, 5, or 6 characters. To improve the efficiency of the password cracking process, a dictionary attack approach is utilized, where common words and modifications are used to crack the passwords. To tackle the issue of cracking passwords through lookup tables, the passwords are salted before being hashed with SHA-256, where a random salt is appended to a selected word from a dictionary.

To attack some password, using a rainbow table is also a good application of the space/time tradeoff.
